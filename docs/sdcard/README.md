# Raspberry Pi Headless Wifi & SSH Setup

* Edit wpa_supplicant.conf with your wifi settings - use a text editor that can do Unix line-endings (LF), or be sure not to hit enter/add any lines to the file, or it won't work

* Copy over these files to your fresh raspberry pi sd card's /boot partition before first boot to setup wifi and enable ssh without a keyboard/monitor

* The config.txt file has a few changes to help support the Walabot device
